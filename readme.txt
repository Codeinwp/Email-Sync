Sync your WordPress email addresses with your favorite email marketing software

== Description ==

Do you run an ecommerce or membership site with WordPress? Ever wished your registered users in WordPress
could be synced with your favorite newsletter software?

The Email Sync WordPress plugin allows you to do this with unparalleled ease. Simply enter your email provider
details and Email Sync will automatically keep your WordPress user's email addresses in sync. When users are
registered Email Sync will subscribe the email address to your email provider. When a user is deleted Email Sync
will unsubscribe the email address. When a users updates their email address Email Sync will update the email address
in your email provider. You get the idea.
